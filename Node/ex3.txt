1. You can't selectively load only the pieces you need with require but with imports, you can selectively load only the pieces you need. That can save memory.

Loading is synchronous(step by step) for require on the other hand import can be asynchronous(without waiting for previous import) so it can perform a little better than require.

 2. to use  the import syntax :

Save the file with .mjs extension, or
Add { "type": "module" } in the nearest package.json.
